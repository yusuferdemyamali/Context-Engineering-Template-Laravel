# Laravel Context Engineering Template

This project is a starter template designed to automate project planning, task creation, and deployment processes for new Laravel projects using the principles of **Context Engineering**. The core purpose is to define project requirements, technical specifications, and rules in structured text files (within the `context/` folder) and automatically generate task lists, reports, and deployment plans from this context (in the `output/` folder).

---

## ✨ Core Philosophy

This template aims to reduce uncertainty at the beginning of the development process. The development team clarifies all aspects of the project before writing a single line of code by following these steps:

1.  **Define the Context (`context/`):** All information, such as project goals, client requirements, technical specifications, and development rules, is documented in Markdown files.
2.  **Run the Commands (`commands/`):** The defined commands use the `context` files and the templates within `prompts` to generate meaningful output.
3.  **Use the Output (`output/`):** The generated task lists, plans, and reports can be used directly for project management and development processes.

## 🚀 How to Use It

To start a new project using this template, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Fill in the Project Context

Edit all `.md` files in the [`context/`](context/) folder according to your project's requirements. This will serve as the project's **single source of truth**.

* **[`project_brief.md`](context/project_brief.md):** Define the overall goals and summary of the project.
* **[`client_requirements.md`](context/client_requirements.md):** List all functional and non-functional requests from the client.
* **[`technical_specifications.md`](context/technical_specifications.md):** Specify the technology stack, architecture, and standards to be used.
* **[`development_rules.md`](context/development_rules.md):** Define coding standards, Git workflow, and testing rules.
* Fill in the other files (`database_schema.md`, `performance_goals.md`, etc.) as appropriate for your project.

### Step 2: Run the Commands

The commands in the [`commands/`](commands/) folder use the `context` and `prompts` folders to generate various outputs. You can run these commands manually or through an automation script.

* **`generate_tasks.txt`:** Creates a detailed task list based on the project documents.
* **`refine_and_deploy.txt`:** Analyzes the current plan and generates optimized instructions for deployment.
* **`performance_security_report.txt`:** Analyzes code snippets or files for security and performance.
* **`breakdown_task_step_by_step.txt`:** Breaks down a single large task into smaller, manageable sub-steps.

### Step 3: Review and Use the Output

Use the files generated in the `output/` folder for project planning, task assignment, and development processes. For example, you can import the `generated_tasks.md` file into your project management tool (Jira, Trello, etc.).
